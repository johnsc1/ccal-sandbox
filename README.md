### Overview 

This repository accompanies the [CCAL website](https://johnsc1.github.io/ccal-web/) to provide a space to explore the CCAL method interactively and 
learn the method in a hands-on way. For more reference on how to apply the CCAL method, please read the [example repository](https://github.com/johnsc1/ccal-examples).

### How to Use 

This repository can be "forked", which creates a copy of the repository in your own account. To fork this repository:
1. Go to the top right corner of the page where the pin, unwatch, fork, and star buttons are. This may be right below your profile icon. 
2. Click on the down arrow on the fork button. 
3. Click "create a new fork". This will redirect you to a new page. 
4. You are required to have an organization and name for the fork. Choose your profile as the organization (at the top of the drop down menu) and keep the name of the repository. 
5. Click on the green "Create fork" button at the bottom of this page.
